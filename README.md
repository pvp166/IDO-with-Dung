# Next.js client

This is the frontend client for our dapp. It is built with Next.js and uses a render-prop pattern (via `lib/Web3Container.js`) so we can easily inject blockchain functionality (i.e. web3, accounts, and the contract instance) into each page.

## Pages

There are three pages:

- `index.js` â€” This is a barebones Next.js page. It links to other pages which are web3-enabled. In your dapp, this can be a landing page.

## The `lib` folder
